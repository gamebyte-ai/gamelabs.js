/**

 * Controllers access models through readonly interfaces (`IHexGrid`,
 * `IStacksTray`) and call `GameOperations` for every mutation. This
 * keeps the controller layer free of domain logic and concentrates all
 * game-state writes in a single, unit-testable utility — per
 * DeveloperNotes.md "Where logic lives" (in-domain operations belong in
 * `utilities/` with the `*Operations` suffix).
 *
 * Holding the concrete mutable {@link HexGrid} / {@link StacksTray}
 * references here (not in controllers) is explicitly endorsed by the
 * rule: "The utility that owns the state exposes the readonly view."
 *
 * Mints {@link BlockItem} instances on placement so each block becomes a
 * tracked grid item with a back-reference to its cell.
