# Gamelabsjs
Gamelabsjs is a mvc like game framework for fast prototyping.
- Basic dependecy injection system with singleton binding
- View-Controler binding
- Strict view implementation separation from application (View-IView-IViewController-ViewController)
- Module support

## App implementation details
### App class (under src folder)
- YourGameApp class extends GamelabsApp class, override methods for applications steps
 - configureDI: bind dependency instances (first modules, then App specific once)
 - configureViews: register view and view controllers (first modules, then App specific once)
 - loadAssets: load assets (first modules, then App specific once)
 - postInitialize: post registration and asset loading tasks (other initilizations, view creations, level loading, user progress loading, trigger game start, ...)
 - onStep: per frame controls and updates

### Assets class (under src folder)
YourGameAssets class containes all needed asset names, types and urls

### Config class (under src folder)
YourGameConfig class containes all user defined values (tweaking behaviours, setting limits, screen transition, timing values, player speed, jump height, turn count, max score, ...)

### Event classes (under src/events folder)
Communication between view controllers and other parts of game uses events
Event class bindings are added to dependecy container

### View classes (under src/views folder)
IView classes:
- they contain methods for view manipulation(nothing is exposed to controllers) and events for view controllers to listen view events (user input, animation complete, object collisions, ...)
View classes:
- Base view classes (WorldViewBase,HudViewBase) implements IView interfaces and initialize, setController methods are implemented in there
- World views extends WorlViewBase which uses [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/llms.txt)
- Hud (ui) views extends HudViewBase which uses [pixijs](https://pixijs.com/llms.txt). Also we can use pixijs-ui and pixijs-layout if they help.
- User defined view classes extend base view classes and only implement postInitialize and preDestroy

### ViewController classes (under src/controllers folder)
- They implement IViewController interface
- initialize method is called after view creation, has parameters for custom view interface and instance resolver to get dependencies
- destroy method is called just before view destruction
